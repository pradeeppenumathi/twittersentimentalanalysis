Twitter provides a platform for individuals to express their opinions on various topics to reach a
bigger audience. Furthermore, it is a valuable source for taking people's views from different
perspectives. Using this platform, we can extract and categorize the data into relevant types. For
Instance, if a company launches a new product, we can extract the data from Twitter. Then we
use preprocessing technique and categories the data into positive or negative feedback by
applying NLP and Machine learning techniques. With these insights, we can make an analysis on
which date.
The goal of the project is to provide trends of the sentiments by analyzing the tweets. This was
achieved by harnessing the data using NLP and Machine learning techniques. We aim to create a
dashboard that has the functionality of evaluating whether the tweeted data is negative or
positive. Besides this, it also has a visualization of the graph that illustrates the trends of the
positive probability of tweets by date. We also aim to find factors that may affect the
userâ€™s sentiments. Although we have used a generic dataset to find the trends in the sentiments, if
we use a brand-specific or topic-specific dataset then this trend will be more insightful for
that particular case
In this report, we divide the project implementation into the different sections. First, addressed
the challenge of finding emotions from text data by utilizing cloud computing, data
preprocessing, and advanced modeling techniques. Second, the data collection from public
platforms . Then Cloud computing, specifically AWS EC2 instances and Amazon S3, which
provides the computational power and secure storage needed for efficient processing. Next,
Spark aids for data processing within this cloud environment and then Data preprocessing is a
pivotal step to ensure accurate analysis. Followed by, exploring various sentiment analysis
models, including Bag of Words, RNN, LSTM, and BERT. After that, results that highlight
insights and model accuracies and limitations where suggest possible extensions. In conclusion,
our paper goes through the implementation of sentiment analysis on Twitter, providing an
understanding of methodologies and results.
